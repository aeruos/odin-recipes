            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

            <li>1 can 100% pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h2><strong>Instructions:</p></h2></strong>

        <p><h4><em>Prepare Crust:</p></em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt to the bowl of a food precessor. Pulse until combined.</li>
            <li>Add in butter and pulse 7 times.</li>
            <li>With the motor running pour in the water and pulse until the dough forms together into a mostly cohesive ball.</li>
            <li>Remove the pastry from the processor and wrap in plastic wrap tightly. Let it rest in the refridgerator for a minimum of 30 minutes, or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pie dough to an 11" circle and line a 9" pie plate, crimping the edges as desired. Prick the bottom, of the dough all over with a fork to let steam escape during baking. Place the pie in the freezer for 30 minutes to let the pie dough chill.</li>
            <li>While dough is chilling, preheat oven to 400 degrees farenheit.</li>
            <li>Remove the pie from the freezer and line the pie dough with a piece of round parchment paper and then add pie weights (or dry rice or beans or lentils) to fill the pie shell, making sure to push pie weights to the edges. Bake for 20 minutes on the lower rack, then remove from oven and remove the parchment and pie weights. Return to the now empty pie shell into the oven and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is fully baked. Lower the oven to 350 degrees. </li>
        </ol>

    <p><h4><em>Make Filling and Bake:</em></h4></p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and eggs until combined. Then, whisk in vanilla, pumpkin puree and heavy cream until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the crust, and bake the pie on the middle rack for 45-55 minutes, or until the edges have started to puff up about 2 to 2-½” inches in, but the center is still slightly wobbly. The middle of the pie should reach an internal temperature of about 180ºF.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature before placing in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours to finish firming up.</li>
        <li>This pie should be stored in the refrigerator. It can be served straight from the refrigerator, or you can let it sit at room temperature for a few hours before serving. Serve with simple whipped cream or maple whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
